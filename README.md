### Portfolio
This is the source code for my portfolio wesbite, which can be found at [connorskudlarek.com](http://www.connorskudlarek.com/)

It uses an express backend to serve a React front end. Sounds like overkill for a portfolio? Probably. I considered using EJS views instead, or even plain vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Both would likely be more performant, though probably unnoticed for such a small application. But what's the fun in that?

I decided that it should make it easier for me to add greater functionality and complexity to my portfolio in the future if I start with React. Maybe with in-portfolio demos of web apps I've built, without needing to leave the page. In that sense, it could be saving me time down the road if I end up adding more features (and I probably will, with login authentication requirements at an /api endpoint to quickly view my database of contacts).
